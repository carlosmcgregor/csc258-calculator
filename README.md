# csc258-calculator
An integer calculator designed for the 1-address computer made by Professor Hehner (http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hehner/258/) 
for the 'Computer Organization' course at UofT. This was uploaded in hopes it will guide some new students in the course who
are challenged by programming in the CSC258 computer.

DISCLAIMER: I DID NOT WRITE THE LAST PART (THE PRINTINT METHOD), AND CREDIT GOES TO WHOEVER WROTE IT! YOU WILL FIND A SIMILAR
DISCLAIMER IN THE CODE ITSELF.
